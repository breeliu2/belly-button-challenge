In this assignment we were tasked to build an interactive dashboard to explore data on microbes that colonize human navels. 
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Interactive Dashboard
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

On the left hand side is a display of an individual's demographic information. The plots will update when a new test subject is selected.

The gauge chart is commented out as I could not get it to show up on the dashboard. :(
